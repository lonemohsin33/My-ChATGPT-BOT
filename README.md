# My-ChATGPT-BOT

### Check it here ----> https://chatgpt-clone-og.netlify.app/

This is a bot of ChatGPt with some more feature like you can choose any moel you want depending on your need?

### The thing i added in this chatbot is that you can selected any model from the given models of openAi which is not possible in the oroginal one.
### The Best of the working versions is the text-davinci-03 model and it is set as default, you can try other models and check their efficiency also.
### You can choose one of the two themes light and dark depending on you choice the original one doesnt give you that. 



# Scripts 

### you can use npm Start to run the frontend and npm start to run the server.






# Using React

### I have used react-hooks like useEffect to fetch the models on mount.

### I have used chakra ui to set most of my designs with little Css. 

### Since i have not made a login page for the site so there isnt any DB nvolved i might change that in future. 




# Few DrawBacks:
### it will not generate different responses at the same time while original one can. this ability might be added to this one sooner or later. 


### Thanks for Reading, Have a Nice Day!
